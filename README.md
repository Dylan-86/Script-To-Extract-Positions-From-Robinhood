## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Use

1. Open the web page containing your stock data https://robinhood.com/us/en/legend/

3. Open your browser's developer tools (`F12` or right-click ‚Üí Inspect).
4. Go to the **Console** tab.
5. Paste the script in **code.js** and press **Enter**.
6. A file named `stocks.csv` will be automatically downloaded.
